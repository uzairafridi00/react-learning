1. A reducer is a function that takes current information about states, like takes in the previous value of state
   also takes in actions that you want to perform on states and returns back the new value of that state.



	import {createSlice} from "@reduxjs/toolkit"


// createSlice is use to create reducer in a very easy way, through which you can easily split your logic.

	
	export const userSlice	= createSlice({

		name: "user",	// name of slice (state)
		initialState: {value: {name: "", age: 0, email: ""} },		// Start value

		
		// All your reducer function comes here
		// Every reducer function or action you take it takes a function and also arguments
		// 1st Arg -> state, 2nd Arg -> action
		

		// State holds info about current and previous state value. Keeping track of states

		// Action is an object containing two different things. payload and type
		// payload is an object which you can pass in information that you want to change. Just like function.
		// type 		

		reducers: {
			login: (state, action) => {
				state.value = action.payload
			} 
		}

	});



	export default userSlice.reducer;





2. In index.js file import the UserReducer.


	import userReducer from "./features/user"


	reducer:{
		user: userReducer
	}
