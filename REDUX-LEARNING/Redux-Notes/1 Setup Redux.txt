1. To Simply Setup React App first we make sure to have or create react app

	npx create-react-app appName --template typescript


2. Now we will install Redux toolkit. Below command will install the three libraries.

	npm install redux react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit



______________________________________


If we have two components side by side or siblings then there is no way to pass data to each other.
We can only pass the props from Parent to Child but for passing the State data to each and every component
we have to use Redux toolkit, Flux or Context API to be accessible in all components.
