1. Now we will grab the value of states and display in our component. We will use useSelector hook to do this.


	import {useSelector} from "react-redux";


	const user = useSelector({state}=> state.user.value)


2. Now we can simply access all the states defined in Reducer (User)

	{user.name} {user.age} {user.email}




3. Now export payload or action of reducers


	export const {login} = userSlice.actions;
