1. Thinking about Store. A store is almost like thinking of a container, something that holds information
   When you create store then it will hold states which we will make it global. Also it will be able to change them.


2. We will create a single store which will hold all the states that we might to change.


3. Import the redux toolkit in index.js file. Your store will contain all the reducers used in your application.

	
	import {configureStore} from "@reduxjs/toolkit"
	import {provider} from "react-redux"


	const store = configureStore({
				
		reducer: {}		

	})



// Wrap the app with Provider to access all the states or to be global.
// Now pass the store that provider will use



	<Provider store={store}>
		<App />
	</Provider>
