import the createContext


const AppContext = createContext(null)


const ContextValue = {
	name: "Uzair",
	age: 20,
	country: "pak",

}



	It will not work perfectly. It gives error of type. In order to define values we have to create interface.
	and pass that interface to createContext()



interface AppContextProvider {
	name: string;
	age: numnber;
	country: string;
}


	
	Now pass this interface to context API to know the types of values.
	We also used UNION sign "|" which indicates that it can be type of interface or null (both).


const AppContext = createContext<AppContextInterface | null>(null)




	Now inside component the values we are making also pass the interface to them



const ContextValue: AppContextInterface = {
	name: "Uzair",
	age: 20,
	country: "pak",

}
