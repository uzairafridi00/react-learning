	let isStudent:boolean;
	let hobbies: string[] or number[]

	let role: [string, number]     
	role = ["student", 5]


	// Defining object but Object contain alot of properties
	let person: Object;       


// Defining Objects

	type or interface define an OBJECT

	type Person = {
		name: string;
		age: number;
	}


// Now we can assign this Person Object to person var

	let person: Person;


// If you want to make any property as an optional add question mark with variable


	type Person {
		name?: string;        // You can pass a value or it can be an optional
		age?: number;
	}


	let person:Person {
		name: "Uzair"

// We can also assign this type to an array of Persons


	let lotsOfPeople: Person[];



// We can also pass two types to one single variable using UNION
// Now you can pass number and string to age variable


	let age: number | string;


// There is also another type "any"
// Doesn't have restriction, you can keep any type in this.
// Not recommended.

	let age: any;


// Instead of "any" ther is another type "unknown"
// Use unknwon if you don't know the type 
// unknown is recommended

	let age: unknown

// Functions


	function printName(name: string) {
		console.log(name)
	}

	
	printName("Uzair")



// We can directly give function type to function just like an object.

	function printName: Function;


// But there is better way to assign type to function
// void means this function doesn't return anything
// At the end void, number, string shows the return type of function


	let printName: (name: string, age: number) => void;            => void returns undefined
	let printName: (name: string, age: number) => number;
	let printName: (name: string, age: number) => string;

	let printName: (name: string, age: number) => never;		=> never doesn't return anything

// We have two types of Aliases (type and interface)
// They both will work same



	type Person {
		name?: string;        // You can pass a value or it can be an optional
		age?: number;
	}	

	interface Person {
		name?: string;        // You can pass a value or it can be an optional
		age?: number;
	}	


_____________________________________________


// Difference 

// TYPE
// If we have two type of X and Y and want to use the properties of X in Y
// then simply pass X to Y with & sign.
// Type is extended
// With type we put = sign


	type X = {
		a: string;
		b: number;
	}

	type Y = X & {
		c: string;
		d: number
	}


	let y: Y = {
		a: "av",
		d: 32
	}




// INTERFACE
// In interface we use extends key word to extends the properties of one interface to another

	
	interface Person {
		name: string;   
		age: number;
	}

	
	interface Male extends Person {
		profession: string;
	}




// We can also extends the interface to type
// It will work fine and vice versa (with interface)

	interface Person {
		name: string;   
		age: number;
	}

	
	type Male = Person & {
		profession: string;
	}
