1) We can set the type of useState using <> this operator


	const [name, setName] = React.useState<string>("");
	


We can also use UNION this | operator to define null as well with string.

	
    const [country, setCountry] = useState<string | null>("")



If we make function so we will also specify the type of Param


	const handleChange = (event: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
        		
			setCountry(event.target.value)

    	}
